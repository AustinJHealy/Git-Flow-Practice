6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 

	The head contains metadata, the <title> tag goes in the head of the document, information about the webpage that does not necessarily get displayed on the page itself.   

7. What is an id? 

	An ID is a selector that allows you to assign a unique name to a specific section of code to allow it to be manipulated more easily by CSS and JS.

8. What elements can I add an id to? 
	
	With HTML5 an id can be added to any HTML element    

9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
	
	An ID is unique and can only be used once per page.

19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
   	
	A class is used to group multiple elements and an ID is used as a unique identifier. You may use a class when changing the attributes of all <p> elements on a page, 
	an ID may be used when trying to isolate a particular section like a 	footer nav bar.

	We would use " .human {} "    

22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
   
	A parent child selector is used to select elements nested inside of other elements. This would be useful when we only want to change the child elements of a specific parent.

23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
  	
	You can use the selector ".sidebar > a {}"

	We would type in "ls" for a list of files/folders in the current directory.
    
33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
   
	To remove a file we type "rm <filename>". This permanently deletes a file, it does not go into Trash/Recycle Bin.

34. Why should I use version control? 
	
	Version control makes it so many people can work together on a project and that software can be saved at many different stages in its development and can be updated to apply bug fixes. Version 
	control basically controls the integrity of the software by branching out a version of code to each developer.   

35. How often should I commit to github?
	
	"Commit early, commit often. " You should commit once you have added any kind of working feature that you want to be saved and to show your work to everyone else working on the project so 
	everyone can work together to build the code.

36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
	
	To push a repo to github we type "git push <remote-name> <branch name> " into the command line. Ex. git push -u origin austin-healy. This will also push to this branch in the future.

37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
	The Lambda's git flow would go like this: 1. Fork, Add your TL as a collaborator, clone your repo, create a branch to work on, add your TL as a reviewer when making pull request. 
	

Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	
	Block level elements always start on a new line and take up the full available page width. Inline elements take up only as much space as needed and do not start on a new line.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	
	Absolute positioning positions an element in relation to another enclosing element. Relative positioning positions an element relative to what its original position would have been.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	
	We can change the display property to inline-block, we can also change the float property.

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	
	 3 elements that are display: block by default are <img>, <p> and <div>, 2 that are inline by default are <a> and <span>. 1 element that is inline-block by default is <input>.
	
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
	
	The box model sees every element on a page as a box with a margin, border and padding around the content in the center. This view comes with its own set of problems like overlapping elements
	 and it creates fragile layouts and is usually not good to use for responsive design. A fix for the box model comes in the form of a code snippet that you can paste into your CSS: 
	" *, *:before, *:after {-moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;} ".
